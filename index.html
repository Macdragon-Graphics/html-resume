        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>Experience and a passion for design are what I bring to every project to help you create memorable and engaging products that achieve results beyond your expectations.
            <br>
            <br>
            I take a stress-free and relaxed approach to support each client's goal. I treat every project with the same care and attention as if it were my own. From magazine production, start to finish, to responsive websites with animations and a CMS (Content Management System). You've found your one-stop shop for all of your graphic needs.
            <br>
            <br>
            I utilize the Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and XD) to create graphics for both print and web. For designing and hosting websites, I work with Webflow.
            <br>
            <br>
            Whether you're already a client or need a little guidance, I'm happy to help. Please message me with any questions you might have.
            </p>
